Mat28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
Mat28:2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
Mat28:3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
Mat28:4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
Mat28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
Mat28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
